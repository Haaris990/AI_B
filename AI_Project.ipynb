    "The 19th Century Travel Journal from the University of Glasgow Special Collections serves as a captivating window into the past, offering insights into the journeys, experiences, and perceptions of travelers during the 1800s.This travel journal, written by a wealthy Scottish man, documents his travels to the South of France including many captivating illustrations to match the entries into the journal. \n",
    "Handwritten and often difficult to decipher, this journal holds invaluable historical and cultural significance, yet its accessibility to the broader public is limited due to the barrier of handwritten text.\n",
    "I will aim to leverage generative AI, specifically handwriting recognition technology, to transcribe and digitise the content of the 19th Century Travel Journal. By doing so, I intend to make the narratives contained within these journals more accessible and comprehensible to a wider audience, thereby fostering engagement with our cultural heritage.\n",

    "My design will incorporate generative AI by utilising advanced machine learning techniques to develop a handwriting recognition model. This model can be trained on a dataset of handwritten text samples, learning to recognise patterns and characters in various handwriting styles.\n",
    "The model architecture typically consists of convolutional neural networks for feature extraction and recurrent neural networks or transformer-based models for sequence modeling and decoding.\n",
    "Training data for the handwriting recognition model would include images of handwritten text along with their corresponding labels (the transcribed text). The model learns to map input images to output text sequences during the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Humans play a crucial role in the training and validation of the handwriting recognition model. I will curate and annotate the training dataset, ensuring that it contains diverse handwriting styles and variations. Once the model is trained, I will verify and correct any errors in the transcribed text, providing feedback to improve the model's accuracy and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging generative AI models for handwriting recognition, I can automate the process of transcribing handwritten content from the 19th Century Travel Journal. This significantly reduces the time and effort required for manual transcription, making the journal's content more accessible to a wider audience. The handwriting recognition model is appropriate for the proposed objective because it can accurately interpret various handwriting styles and nuances, ensuring high-quality transcriptions of the journal's content.\n",
